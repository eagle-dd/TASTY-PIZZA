You will start of with cutting the mozzarella into slices. These should be thin, so that you ecan covr as much
 space as possible with the cheese. Place the cheese on the sauce. cut the salami, pepper and onion into 
 slices as well. Place the salami first, and then add the onion and the pepper on top of the mozzarella. 
 To finish off, add the olives. Add as many as you want. The topping depends fully on your taste and 
 preferences. You could use whatever you want for a pizza topping. You are then finished with the preparation
  process. The next step is to bake the pizza.
